# Hello Everyone

This is just a Python language repo that contains(will contain) programs related to python in general. PLease hold your horses as I will keep adding two to three program(s) every day. There would be repositories in Python and Rust as well, make sure to check them out if you want. Don't forget to leave a star, that's what keeps me motivated.

To run any of the listed programs, follow the CLI commands /-

```
python<version> prims.py
```

Remember to replace `prims.py` with the filename you want to execute, and the `version` with the python version you are using.

Also, I also have a C language repo on my GitHub, make sure check that out as well by clicking on the link below!
